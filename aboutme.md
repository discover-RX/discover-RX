### Our story

From January 2021, we have been working on a web application that interfaces with Spotify to help users hone in on their reccommendations. As music lovers, we made something that we could be proud of. Our application allows users to create new playlists from their most recent listening history, create playlists from already existing playlists, and filter these suggested playlists by utilizing traditional music information (artist, album, year) but also using Spotify's audio feature data (danceability, energy, etc.). We hope that we can empower Spotify user's to find new music with our application.
