# Our Application
DiscoveRx is a web application designed to give high quality and customizable music recommendations on demand.  The application interfaces with Spotify to do this making the process seamless.  We have a custom recommendation algorithm using data from our database with 25 million records.  We allow further customization of your music recommendations based on 32 filters that allow the user to make restrictions based on things like the beats per minute, how popular the song is, or how many beats appear in each bar.  We hope that we can empower Spotify userâ€™s to find new music with our application. Check out our application [here!](https://discoverx-capstone.herokuapp.com/)
